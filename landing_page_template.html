			For each 3D structure of a drug-like ligand bound to the specified domain of a human protein, the % of the ligand surface that becomes shielded from solvent upon binding is calculated. If multiple structures are available for a given protein, the highest value is retained. The percentages shown in this column are the median values across all proteins for the specified domain. The higher the number, the more desolvated the compound, the more enclosed - and presumably ligandable - the pocket. This value is less reliable when it is derived from few proteins (column “Proteins with bound ligand in the PDB”) <br>
			<B>> 80%: ligandable. <br> < 70% not ligandable</B>

		<div class='popup'>
			For each 3D structure of a drug-like ligand bound to the specified domain of a human protein, the affinity of the ligand for the protein domain is extracted from the PDBbind database (http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/). If multiple structures are available for a given protein, the lowest value (i.e. highest affinity) is retained. The values shown in this column are the median values across all proteins for the specified domain. The lower the number, the more ligandable the pocket. This value is less reliable when it is derived from few proteins (column “Proteins with ligand affinity data”)
